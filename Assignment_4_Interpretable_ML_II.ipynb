        "The Boosted Rules Classifier is a powerful ensemble learning method that sequentially combines weak classifiers to improve overall model accuracy. In my evaluation, the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 75.5% on the test dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Algorithm\n",
        "The Boosted Rules Classifier is an ensemble method that builds a sequence of weak learners (often simple decision trees) to create a strong predictive model. By focusing on misclassified instances, it aims to improve overall accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Initialization:\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm starts with a weak learner, such as a shallow decision tree, initialized to make predictions on the training data (X_train and y_train). The first model might not capture complex patterns due to its simplicity.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Fitting the Model:\n",
        "\n",
        "For my  dataset, the model is fitted to the predictors:\n",
        "pclass: Integer (1, 2, or 3) representing the passenger class.\n",
        "sex: Binary (0 for male, 1 for female).\n",
        "age: Float (the age of the passenger).\n",
        "fare: Float (the ticket fare).\n",
        "The model generates initial predictions based on these features, classifying passengers as either survived (1) or not survived (0).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Error Calculation:\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm calculates the error by comparing its predictions against the actual survival labels (y_train). Instances that were misclassified are noted for increased attention in the next iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Weight Adjustment:\n",
        "\n",
        "The weights of the misclassified instances are increased, meaning the model will prioritize these cases in the next iteration. For example, if a female passenger in first class was misclassified, the next model will give more emphasis on learning from similar instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Iterative Process:\n",
        "\n",
        " Each new model learns from the mistakes of previous models, refining its predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Final Prediction:\n",
        "\n",
        "The final output combines the predictions of all weak learners. Models that performed better on misclassified instances contribute more heavily to the final classification."
